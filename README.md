Collection+JSON TypeScript Client Library
=========================================

Description
---
This is a pure TypeScript representation of the Collection+JSON - Hypermedia Type ([specs](https://github.com/collection-json/spec)) for the client side.

Purpose
---
This library should provide a proper representation for the Collection+JSON specification in a generic way, so that it will be easy to write extensions for Angular or other client-side frameworks.

Using yarn
---

Yarn is a faster more secure alternative to npm and perfectly compatible with npm repository.
To use it just run `yarn` instead of `npm install`

Frequently used commands
- `yarn add package_name (-D)` installs a package and adds it to the package.json (if th   -D is specified it will add it to the devDependencies)
- `yarn remove package_name` removes the package and deletes it from the package.json file
