Collection+JSON TypeScript Client Library
=========================================

Description
---
This is a pure TypeScript representation of the Collection+JSON - Hypermedia Type ([specs](https://github.com/collection-json/spec)) for the client side.

Purpose
---
This library should provide a proper representation for the Collection+JSON specification in a generic way, so that it will be easy to write extensions for Angular or other client-side frameworks.
